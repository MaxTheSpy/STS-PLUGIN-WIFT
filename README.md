# About

WiFi File Transfer (WIFT)  is a seamless and user friendly tool designed to simplify the file sharing between devices over a WiFi network. By combining the power of a flask web server and an intuitive user interface, WIFT enables users to upload, download, and manage files directly from the plugin or browser.

I personally pair this plugin with our QR Code Generator (QRCG) to create 2 QR codes. One to let my friends connect to my local network and the second to bring them directly to the WIFT Web page. Once connected, we can all share flash cards, D&D Campaign notes, and whatever else we are working on. All it takes is a few seconds to start up.

### Key Features

- Starts a Flask-based web server to host files for upload and download.
- Displays real-time file lists with detailed information such as file type.
- Automatically detects the local IP address and provides the URL for accessing the server.
- No Internet required.
